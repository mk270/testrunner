,1,Quality of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or Disclosure Policy,FOIA,foia,"The definition used in the Rating for a Freedom of Information Act is that it has to be a law in the strict sense, it must include the right of access to information, this right has to be enforceable and there must be complaint, court and high court appeal possibilities. Decrees are included if they meet the same standards. In addition, the FOIA must be in use for at least the executive part of the government, therefore FOIAs which are only adopted, approved or still in draft form were not counted. For multilateral donors, IFIs and foundations, a disclosure or transparency policy was accepted as equivalent to a FOIA. Publish What You Fund completed an assessment of the quality of these disclosure policies based on the overarching approach taken in the Global Right to Information Rating.
In the 2011 pilot, a binary yes/no answer was accepted for this indicator without any assessment of the quality of the legislation. The authors recognised this was unsatisfactory and a new data source has been found for 2012 so an assessment of the quality of the legislation is now possible.",organisation,0.02778,"Global Right to Information Rating, Centre for Law and Democracy and Access Info Europe, September 2011."
,2,Engagement in IATI,IATI,,"Donors are engaged in IATI if they are signatories. Of the 33 signatories, some are already implementing, i.e. they have published to the IATI Registry within the last 12 months; others have published an implementation schedule but have not yet published to the Registry or they published data that is now more than 12 months old; and a third group have not published an implementation schedule or confirmed when they expect to publish to the Registry.",organisation,0.05556,"The level of engagement in the International Aid Transparency Initiative, taken from the IATI website and the donors' implementation schedules."
,3,Publishes overarching strategy document,Strategy,strategy,"An overarching strategy document explains the general approach and policies of the donor towards international development.
This is a new indicator for 2012. Feedback from the 2011 survey identified that publishing an overarching strategy document is considered best practice for setting out an organisation's overall approach and policies and that the majority of organisations produce these documents.",organisation,0.02778,Does this organisation publish an overarching strategy document?
,4,Publishes annual report,Annual report,annual-report,"Annual reports outline basic (normally aggregate) information about how aid was spent in the previous year, broken down by sector and / or country.
This is a new indicator for 2012. Feedback from the 2011 Tracker survey highlighted the importance of annual reports for providing an overview of an organisation's budget, areas of focus and spending in an accessible and user-friendly format. They are also a first step for organisations in providing more information to their constituencies about their work.",organisation,0.02778,Does this organisation publish an annual report?
,5,Publishes aid allocation policies and procedures,Allocation policy,allocation,"Aid allocation policies and procedures are the detailed policy and procedure documents by which the organisation chooses where to spend its resources, i.e. on which countries or themes rather than others. Relatively general documents or webpages outlining which countries, themes and institutions the agency will fund are accepted, as long as this is forward-looking and not wholly retrospective.",organisation,0.02778,Does this organisation publish its aid allocation policy and procedure?
,6,Publishes total organisation budget for next three years,Total budget,total-budget,"The total organisation budget is the total amount that the organisation will be allocated by the government or its funders for at least the next three years.
This is money going to the organisation, and can be indicative. Both rolling budgets and non-rolling budgets were accepted if they ran up to 2015.",organisation,0.02778,"Does this organisation publish the total organisation budget for the next three years, up to 2015?"
,7,Publishes annual forward planning budget for next three years,Disaggregated budget,,"The organisation's annual forward planning budget for assistance is the disaggregated budget that the organisation or agency will spend on different countries, programmes and institutions for at least the next three years.
This is money being spent by the donor organisation, and could be indicative. Ideally we would have distinguished between rolling and long term budgets (e.g. a five year budget) but for the purpose of the survey both rolling budgets and long term budgets were accepted.
All the EC agencies included in the Index (DG DEVCO, DG Enlargement, ECHO and FPI) were at the end of their fixed budget cycles and therefore did not have a budget for the next three years. In this case they did not receive points for this indicator.",organisation,0.02778,"Does this organisation publish their annual forward planning budget for assistance to different countries and institutions for the next three years, up to 2015?"
,8,Publishes procurement procedures,Procurement policy,procurement-policy,"An organisation's procurement procedures explain the process used to tender and contract (invite bids for) goods and services. This must fully explain the criteria on which decisions are made, and could be in a single procurement policy document or attached to each tender.
For development finance institutions which are often demand-driven, this was understood as their investment policy.",organisation,0.02778,Does this organisation publish its procurement procedures?
,9,Publishes tenders,Tenders,tenders,"Tenders are the individual contracts or proposals that have been put out to invite bids from companies or organisations who want to provide goods and services for an activity. They may be on a separate website, possibly on a central government procurement website.
This was an activity level question in the 2011 Tracker survey, but as organisations often publish tenders separately and on a central website the question was in practice answered at the organisation level. It has therefore been moved to this level for 2012.",organisation,0.02778,Does this organisation publish all tenders?
,10,Publishes annual audit of programmes,Audit,audit,"The organisation's annual audit of its activities is an official inspection of the accounts and activities of this organisation, typically by an independent body.",organisation,0.02778,Does this organisation publish an annual audit of its aid programmes?
,11,"Centralised, online database",Database,,"An online database of all the activities in all countries is a website which contains all of the activities of this donor across the world, disaggregated to the level of a project. This should include comprehensive information about the organisation's projects, including title, cost, start/end dates, implementing organisation and a description of the activity.
This is a new question for the 2012 Tracker survey. Findings from the 2011 survey identified that centralised, online databases that are publicly accessible make it much easier to search for and find information about the organisation's activities and compare them with other organisations.",organisation,0.02778,"Is there a centralised, online public database of all the organisation's activities in all countries?
If the respondent answered this question positively then a follow up question was asked: What format is this information provided in? The answer to this question was used to assess the usefulness of the organisation's data but it was not scored or used in the Index ranking."
,12,Publishes country strategy paper,Strategy,country-strategy,"A country strategy paper sets out the organisation's planned approach and activities in the recipient country. For it to be accepted it needed to be a detailed document, rather than just a paragraph on the organisation's website.",country,0.04762,Does this organisation publish the country strategy paper for this recipient country?
,13,Publishes forward planning budget for country for next three years,Budget,country-budgets,"The organisation's annual forward planning budget for assistance is the budget that the organisation will spend on this country for at least the next three years.
This is money being spent by the organisation and can be indicative. As above, both rolling budgets and non-rolling budgets were accepted if they ran up to 2015. Indicative three-year figures disaggregated to the level of theme or region were accepted for private foundations and trusts.",country,0.04762,Does this organisation publish forward planning budget or documents for the activities they fund in this recipient country for the next three years?
,14,Publishes Memorandum of Understanding,MoU,mou,"A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is a document which details the agreement usually between the organisation and recipient government for the provision of aid in the country.
Some DFIs do not sign MoUs, so equivalent documents have been allowed. Further explanation of what has been accepted is provided in Annex 1.
This was an activity level question in the 2011 Tracker survey, but as MoUs relate to bilateral agreements between a donor organisation and a government the question was in practice answered at the country level. It has therefore been moved to this level for 2012.",country,0.04762,Is the Memorandum of Understanding published?
,15,Publishes evaluation documents,Evaluations,evaluations,"Evaluation documents consider what activity achieved, whether the intended objectives were met, what the major factors influencing the achievement or non-achievement of the objectives were and an assessment of the impact, effect and value of the activity. This information may be on a specific evaluation section of the organisation's website.",country,0.04762,Are evaluation documents published for all completed activities in this recipient country?
,16,"Publishes results, outcomes and outputs documentation",Results,results,The results show whether activities achieved their intended outputs in accordance with the stated goals or plans. This information often refers to logframes and results chains and may be within a specific results or evaluation section of the organisation's website.,country,0.04762,"Are results, outcomes and outputs published for all completed activities in this recipient country?"
,17,Publishes current activities in this country,All current activities,,"Activities need to be current, ongoing activities broken down by sector or region and including details of budget and timeframe, not just details of completed activities.
If the information was introduced with any qualifiers (such as 'major projects', 'lighthouse projects', 'key projects', 'case studies') then this was not considered as comprehensive publication of all activities. Donors were asked to verify if these responses were correct.
This is a new indicator for 2012. Findings from the 2011 Tracker survey highlighted the need to be able to identify all activities currently being delivered by an organisation in that country, and as a way of signposting the likelihood of systematic publication at the activity level.",country,0.04762,Does this organisation publish information about all of its current activities in this recipient country?
,18,"Centralised, online country database",Database,,"An online database of all the activities in the recipient country is a website which contains all of the activities of this donor in the country, disaggregated to the level of a project. This should include comprehensive information about the donor's projects, including title, cost, start/end dates, implementing organisation and a description of the activity.
If an organisation scores on indicator 11 then they will score again on this indicator, but not necessarily vice versa. For example, Canada is gradually publishing comprehensive activity data for each country it operates in, including for Haiti (Canada's biggest recipient country reviewed in the survey), but it does not yet have public, comprehensive database for all its activities in all the countries it operates in.
This is a new indicator for 2012. Feedback from the 2011 Tracker survey identified that centralised, online country databases that are publicly accessible make it much easier to search for and find information about the organisation's activities and compare them with other organisations operating in that country.",country,0.04762,"Is there a centralised, online, public database of all the organisation's activities in this recipient country?
As with indicator 11 above, if the respondent answered this question positively then a follow up question was asked: What format is this information provided in? The answer was used to assess the comparability of the organisation's data but it was not scored or used in the Index ranking."

,20,Publishes collaboration type,Collaboration type,collaboration-type,"The collaboration type shows how the activity is funded ?? whether directly from one government to another (bilaterally), through institutions such as the World Bank or UN (multilaterally), or otherwise. This needed to be explicitly stated.
To be accepted, responses had to be stated per activity, or once in a country strategy paper or a clear place on the website, if there is only one collaboration type for the whole organisation (e.g. 'all aid is funded bilaterally').*",activity,0.01333,"Does this organisation publish the 'Collaboration Type', i.e. whether the activity is funded bilaterally or multilaterally, as a contribution to NGOs, to Public-Private Partnerships, or as multilateral outflow?"
,21,Publishes flow type,Flow type,flow-type,"The flow type shows whether the organisation states this activity counts as ODA, OOF, climate finance or any other type of flow. This had to be explicitly stated per activity, or once in a country strategy paper or a single place on the organisation's website if there is only one flow type for all activities (e.g. 'all aid is ODA').*",activity,0.01333,"Does this organisation publish the 'Flow Type', i.e. whether the activity is categorised as Official Development Assistance (ODA), Other Official Flows (OOF), climate finance or anything else?"
,22,Publishes type of aid given,Aid type,aid-type,"The type of aid shows whether the activity is classed as budget support, a project, technical assistance, debt relief, administrative costs, and so on. This needed to be explicitly stated per activity, or once in a country strategy paper or on a clear place on the organisation's website if there is only one aid type for the whole organisation (e.g. 'all aid is project-type interventions').*
For DFIs, the organisation needs to clearly state if there are any eligibility requirements for contracts based on country of origin.",activity,0.01333,"Does this organisation publish the type of aid given (e.g. budget support, pooled funds, project-type interventions, experts, scholarships, debt relief, administrative costs)?"
,23,Publishes type of finance given,Finance type,finance-type,"The type of finance shows whether the activity is a grant, loan, export credit or debt relief.

,24,Publishes unique project identifier,Unique ID,unique-id,"The activity identifier is a unique reference ID for the activity (e.g. a project number). It allows an activity to be referred to and searched for by a code, which can be used to retrieve the project from a database or filing system.
The project ID must be stated clearly on the page. It is not sufficient if it is only stated in the URL.",activity,0.01333,Does this organisation publish a unique activity identifier (e.g. a project number)?

Sometimes it was just a short sentence but could also be more detailed. Either was accepted.",activity,0.01333,Does this organisation publish a description of the activity?
,27,Publishes which sectors the activity relates to,Sectors,sector,"The sectors of the activity explain whether this is, for example, a health or education project.

,28,Publishes sub-national geographic location,Sub-national location,location,"The sub-national geographic location is information about where the activity is located within a country. This may be a province or city, or it could be geo-coded (whereby the precise longitude and latitude is published). It needed to be stated separately and explicitly.
This is a new indicator for 2012. Feedback from the 2011 Tracker survey highlighted the need to be able to identify the location of an activity within a country in order to obtain information about all the activities being delivered within the same province or city. This indicator is not applicable for projects that are a) allocated to a collection of countries (e.g. a supranational region); or b) funded via general budget support, where just the country name was accepted.",activity,0.01333,Does this organisation publish the sub-national geographic location for this activity?
,29,Publishes planned start / end dates,Planned dates,dates-planned,"The planned dates are the dates that the activity is scheduled to start and end on. If there are one set of dates but they are not explicitly planned or actual dates, given that these are for activities which are current (i.e. being implemented at the time of data collection) it was assumed that they were planned dates.*
Just the year (rather than month and year) has been accepted for this indicator. This is generous as in some cases donors are publishing the month and the year. In some cases, they publish day, month and year (for instance, the date a contract was signed is taken as the start date). In future indices, this indicator might be interpreted more strictly in recognition of recipient countries needing to be able to map planned activities to their own financial year rather than the calendar year.",activity,0.01333,Does this organisation publish the planned start and end dates?
,30,Publishes actual start / end dates,Actual dates,dates-actual,"These are the dates that the activity actually started (and ended on, if the activity has finished). If there was only one set of dates but they are not explicitly stated as planned or actual dates, then it was assumed they were planned dates. Actual dates were accepted where specific events occurred, for example the date the project/programme agreement was signed, a board presentation or an appraisal date.*
As with indicator 29, just the year (rather than month and year) has been accepted for this indicator. In future indices, this indicator might be interpreted differently in recognition of recipient countries needing to be able to map activities to their own financial year rather than the calendar year.",activity,0.01333,"Does this organisation publish the actual start and end dates?
(If they are not explicitly stated as actual dates then it is assumed that they are planned dates.)"
,31,Publishes tied aid status,Tied aid status,tied-aid-status,"The tied aid status shows whether the organisation states that this activity counts as 'tied' (e.g. procurement is restricted to the donor organisation country) or 'untied' (open procurement).

This information is unlikely to be made available if the organisation does not publish to IATI.
In the 2011 Pilot Index, this indicator was combined with 34 below. It has been split into two indicators in 2012 as feedback on the 2011 survey identified the need to distinguish between planned and actual expenditure.
